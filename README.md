### Project Notes ###

* Within the resources folder there is a proto-compiler.sh shell script that uses the bundled wire-compiler to compile the Protocol Buffer definitions into java code. This script should be run to update the Java classes any time one of the Protocol Buffer schemas change.
* Proper tablet support is a work in progress.
